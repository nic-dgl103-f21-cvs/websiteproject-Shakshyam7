         <a href="image/artist.jpg"><img src="image/artist.jpg" alt="Me"  height = "400"  width= "400"></a>
        <p>Sunita was born in Nepal, lived in South Africa, and moved with her family to the Comox Valley in 2009. While she has always had an affinity for art, Sunita focused her time and energy towards raising her daughters and building a home. Now that both of her daughters are grown, she has found the time to pursue her passion for painting.
         After taking a few classes and workshops to enhance her natural talent, Sunita finds it hard to put the paintbrush down. She focuses on bringing beautiful natural landscapes to life by using Wet-on-Wet Oil Painting techniques. Painting has completely changed Sunita’s perspective on nature; every tree is a new brush stroke and every waterfall a new texture.</p>
